# Welcome to _**Awesome WisBlock Unified Enclosures**_ ![RAK](../assets/RAK-Whirls.png)

When you buy our awesome WisBlock Unified Enclosures, you can select matching mounting plates to mount your WisBlock Base Board and modules in the enclosures.    

But as usual, that's not where we stop <img src="../assets/rakstar.jpg" alt="RAKstar" width=5%>.    
Often you need your very special mounting plate, be it to fix a battery or your antenna.    

To make it easier for you, we share here some ideas for mounting plates as well as blank plates that you can use as a template to create your own design.
