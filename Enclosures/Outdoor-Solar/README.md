# Outdoor Enclosure with Solar Panel
This enclosure keeps your solution protected and charged with its Solar panel. Most outdoor enclosures with solar panels I saw have the problem that the solar panel is not pointing towards the sky, which limits the charging performance.

## Design details
The body part of the enclosure has openings for    
- the antenna (it is advised to use a water-tight N-type antenna connector instead of the standard SMA connector in the design)
- a PG7 wire gland
- a small lid to access the USB port of the WisBlock    
- preparation for a 18650 battery holder, but as you can see in the picture, I put a flat Li-Ion battery for the test.

The top part has only the space to hold the solar panel. For a version without a solar panel, this space should be closed.

## Mounting
The design supports the use of the same brackets used with the [RAKBox-B2](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKBox-B2) or [RAKBox-B4](https://docs.rakwireless.com/Product-Categories/Accessories/RAKBox-B4) enclosures. These brackets can be used for both wall or post mounting.
