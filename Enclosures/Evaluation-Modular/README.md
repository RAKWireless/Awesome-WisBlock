## Design files
The 3D design files can be found in the [3D-Design](./3D-Design) folder.    
Available formats:  
- Fusion 360 (.f3z)
- Object format (.obj)
- Sketchup format (.skp)
- SMT format (.smt)
- Step format (.step)    

Exported STL files for loading into your slicer are in the [STL](./STL) folder.

For a longer lasting solution, an additional design that uses screws to keep the enclosure modules together, can be found in the [Screw-Version](../Screw-Version) folder.

## Design details

The WisBlock carrier case gives easy access to all Sensor and IO slots and keeps your WisBlock protected.

----

The carrier case size is good to hold your WisBlock Base and the largest WisBlock IO modules.    

----
![IO-Module](../../assets/evaluation-modular-1.jpg)    

----
It allows access to the Sensor slots located at the bottom of the WisBlock Base.

----

For battery powered solutions you can choose between two different battery clip-on cases. One for an 18650 battery and a smaller one for a flat Li-Ion battery.

----

The WisBlock base carrier has an opening to guide the battery wires from the battery case to the carrier case.

----

If you are using external sensors connected to a WisBlock IO module a small opening in the lid allows the wires to get out of the enclosure.
